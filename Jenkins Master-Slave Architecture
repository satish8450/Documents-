Jenkins Master and Slave concept 

I Have configure One Master node with Java 11 - Jenkins Up and running 
Launched another Instance and installed Java 11 

In Master we need to configure Slave system 
Manage Jenkins --> Manage Nodes and Clouds --> New Node
Add the node name as Permanent Agent 
Provide below information to add Jenkins agent
Name: As your wish 
Description: As ur wish 
Number of executors: 2
Remote root directory: /opt/Build --> Workspace will create in Slave 
Labels: Name of the job 

Usage:
   Use this node as much as possible -- default 
   Only build jobs with label expressions matching this node -- if the lables name matched that job only excute 
Launch Method 
 Launch agent by connecting it to the master --- Commands will run on slave to connect with master 
 Launch agent via execution of command on the controller -- Commands will run on Master to connect with slave 
 
 Custom WorkDir path: Logs will stored here (remote root directory--/opt/Build)
 
 Use WebSocket [x] click on this 
 
 Availability:
Keep this agent online as much as possible ---This one 
Bring this agent online according to a schedule
Bring this agent online when in demand, and take offline when idle

Slave Node Created Successfully . We need to communicate our salve to master by using agent.jar 

This is the error will get 

Run from agent command line:
"
curl -sO http://18.183.16.218:8080/jnlpJars/agent.jar
java -jar agent.jar -jnlpUrl http://18.183.16.218:8080/manage/computer/Slave%201/jenkins-agent.jnlp -workDir "/opt/buildserver "

Click on agent.jar it will download in our local 

Copy this jar file from local to slave mechince under /opt

Now Excute below command 

java -jar agent.jar -jnlpUrl http://18.183.16.218:8080/manage/computer/Slave%201/jenkins-agent.jnlp -workDir "/opt/buildserver "

please check befor excuting jenkins ulr which is correct or not 

Finally slave will connected to Master
