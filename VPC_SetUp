These are the following procedure to setup VPC 
 Vpc is customised network to isolate the appliction

Step 1:
 First we need to create VPC with one public and private subnet 
   Ex : VPC cidr block is 10.0.0.0/16 total 65,536 Ips will allocate
       subnet1 PUBLIC 10.0.0.0/24 total 256 ips will allocate 
       subnet2 PRIVATE 10.0.1.0/24 total 256 ips will allocate 
 Remaining Ips Will be future purpose 
 
 Step 2:
 Create NATGAtWay for Vpc that will help to access the public subent thorough internet 
 
 Create INTERNETGATEWAY and attach to present VPC
 For Internet accesss  we neef to create one routetable 
 
 By Default Public and Private subnets attched to same route table but here we need to provide internet access to only Public 
 Creat another routable attach to Public subnet and edit rule in routable as 0.0.0.0/0 Tagert as INTERNETGATEWAY 
 
    So Here PUBILC SUBNET attach to Created  ROUTETABLE with internet acces through INTERNETGATEWAY 
            PRIVATE SUBNET attach to default ROUTETABLE
 
 Step 3 : EC2 Creation 
    
    launch two Instances under VPC Public and Private subnets
    We can able to access the Public subnet instace beacuse this subnet assocaited with routetable, we define route table rule as 0.0.0.0/0 target as IGW 
    Privatesubet instance dont have routetable but can connet through publich instance by using pemkey and ssh connecion.
